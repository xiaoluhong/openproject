                      We are glad you joined! We suggest to try a few things to get started in OpenProject.

                      But before you jump right into it, you should know that this exemplary project is split up into two different projects:

                      1.  [Construction project](%{base_url}/projects/demo-planning-constructing-project): Here you will find the classical roles, some workflows and work packages for your construction project.
                      2.  [Creating BIM Model](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bim-project): This project also offers roles, workflows and work packages but especially in the BIM context.

                      _Try the following steps:_

                      1.  _Invite new members to your project_: → Go to [Members](%{base_url}/projects/demo-construction-project/members) in the project navigation.
                      2.  _View the work in your projects_: → Go to [Work packages](%{base_url}/projects/demo-construction-project/work_packages?query_props=%7B%22c%22%3A%5B%22type%22%2C%22id%22%2C%22subject%22%2C%22status%22%2C%22assignee%22%2C%22priority%22%5D%2C%22hl%22%3A%22priority%22%2C%22hi%22%3Atrue%2C%22g%22%3A%22%22%2C%22t%22%3A%22startDate%3Aasc%22%2C%22f%22%3A%5B%7B%22n%22%3A%22bcfIssueAssociated%22%2C%22o%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22v%22%3A%5B%22f%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22pa%22%3A1%2C%22pp%22%3A100%2C%22dr%22%3A%22list%22%7D) in the project navigation.
                      3.  _Create a new work package_: → Go to [Work packages → Create](%{base_url}/projects/demo-construction-project/work_packages/new?query_props=%7B%22c%22%3A%5B%22type%22%2C%22id%22%2C%22subject%22%2C%22status%22%2C%22assignee%22%2C%22priority%22%5D%2C%22hl%22%3A%22priority%22%2C%22hi%22%3Atrue%2C%22g%22%3A%22%22%2C%22t%22%3A%22startDate%3Aasc%22%2C%22f%22%3A%5B%7B%22n%22%3A%22bcfIssueAssociated%22%2C%22o%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22v%22%3A%5B%22f%22%5D%7D%5D%2C%22pa%22%3A1%2C%22pp%22%3A100%2C%22dr%22%3A%22list%22%7D&type=11).
                      4.  _Create and update a Gantt chart_: → Go to [Gantt chart](%{base_url}/projects/demo-construction-project/work_packages?query_props=%7B%22c%22%3A%5B%22type%22%2C%22id%22%2C%22subject%22%2C%22assignee%22%2C%22responsible%22%5D%2C%22tv%22%3Atrue%2C%22tzl%22%3A%22weeks%22%2C%22hl%22%3A%22priority%22%2C%22hi%22%3Atrue%2C%22g%22%3A%22%22%2C%22t%22%3A%22startDate%3Aasc%22%2C%22f%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22pa%22%3A1%2C%22pp%22%3A100%2C%22dr%22%3A%22list%22%7D) in the project navigation.
                      5.  _Activate further modules_: → Go to [Project settings → Modules](%{base_url}/projects/demo-construction-project/settings/modules).
                      6.  _Check out the tile view to get an overview of your BCF issues:_ → Go to [Work packages](%{base_url}/projects/demo-construction-project/work_packages?query_props=%7B%22c%22%3A%5B%22type%22%2C%22id%22%2C%22subject%22%2C%22status%22%2C%22assignee%22%2C%22priority%22%5D%2C%22hl%22%3A%22priority%22%2C%22hi%22%3Atrue%2C%22g%22%3A%22%22%2C%22t%22%3A%22id%3Aasc%22%2C%22f%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22pa%22%3A1%2C%22pp%22%3A100%2C%22dr%22%3A%22card%22%7D)

                      We are glad you joined! We suggest to try a few things to get started in OpenProject.

                      This demo project shows BCF management functionalities.

                      _Try the following steps:_

                      1.  _Invite new members to your project:_ → Go to [Members](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bcf-management-project/members?show_add_members=true) in the project navigation.
                      2.  _Upload and view 3D-models in IFC format:_ → Go to [BCF](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bim-project/bcf) in the project navigation.
                      3.  _Create and manage BCF issues linked directly in the IFC model:_ → Go to [BCF](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bim-project/bcf) → Create.
                      4.  _View the BCF files in your project:_ → Go to [BCF](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bcf-management-project/work_packages?query_props=%7B%22c%22%3A%5B%22type%22%2C%22id%22%2C%22subject%22%2C%22status%22%2C%22assignee%22%2C%22priority%22%5D%2C%22hl%22%3A%22status%22%2C%22hi%22%3Atrue%2C%22g%22%3A%22%22%2C%22t%22%3A%22id%3Aasc%22%2C%22f%22%3A%5B%5D%2C%22pa%22%3A1%2C%22pp%22%3A100%2C%22dr%22%3A%22card%22%7D) in the project navigation.
                      5.  _Load your BCF files:_ → Go to [BCF → Import.](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bcf-management-project/issues/upload)
                      6.  _Create and update a Gantt chart:_ → Go to [Gantt chart](%{base_url}/projects/demo-bcf-management-project/work_packages?query_props=%7B%22c%22%3A%5B%22id%22%2C%22subject%22%2C%22startDate%22%2C%22dueDate%22%5D%2C%22tv%22%3Atrue%2C%22tzl%22%3A%22days%22%2C%22hi%22%3Atrue%2C%22g%22%3A%22%22%2C%22t%22%3A%22startDate%3Aasc%22%2C%22f%22%3A%5B%7B%22n%22%3A%22status%22%2C%22o%22%3A%22o%22%2C%22v%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%5D%2C%22pa%22%3A1%2C%22pp%22%3A100%7D) in the project navigation.
