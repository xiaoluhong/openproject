## Update existing subscriptions

If you want to up- or downgrade the amount of users of an existing subscription, click on the subscription listed at the top.

![Cloud-edit-subscription](Cloud-edit-subscription.png)

Here you can either **Edit or Cancel the existing subscription**.

### Upgrade or downgrade subscription

You can **upgrade an existing subscription** at any time. Open the [Manage subscription menu](#manage-your-subscription). Additional users will be billed on a prorated basis, this means you will only pay the amount of additional users until the end of the current subscription period.

You can **downgrade a subscription** to the end of a current subscription period. This means the downgrade becomes active with the next payment term.

Click the **Edit Subscription** link.

Click the blue **Update your subscription now button** to save the changes.
