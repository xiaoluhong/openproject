Here you can either **Edit or Cancel the existing subscription**.

### Upgrade or downgrade subscription

You can **upgrade an existing subscription** at any time. Open the [Manage subscription menu](#manage-your-subscription). Additional users will be billed on a prorated basis, this means you will only pay the amount of additional users until the end of the current subscription period.

You can **downgrade a subscription** to the end of a current subscription period. This means the downgrade becomes active with the next payment term.

Click the **Edit Subscription** link.

Click the blue **Update your subscription now button** to save the changes.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Please note that the minimum number of users is 5. You can then increase the number of users in steps of 5. Just write an email to sales@openproject.com.

### Is it possible to change the number of users in the OpenProject Cloud Edition?

You can always increase the number of users. The number of users can be increased in steps of 5 (e.g. you could start with 5 users and then increase the number of users to 10 users).

### Do you have OpenProject guest accounts?

Currently, all users working in the OpenProject Enterprise Edition need a license in order to access OpenProject. Regarding payments we only count the active (not blocked) users.

### Can I run OpenProject as a single user?

Our minimum plan for the Cloud Edition and Enterprise Edition is five users. Our pricing scheme covers three subscription options: Community ($0), Cloud (€4.95/member/month or approximately $5.60/member/month), and Enterprise (€5.95/member/month or approximately $6.73/member/month). We recommend to start the [community version](https://www.openproject.org/download-and-installation/) free of charge if the 5 user minimum is an issue.
