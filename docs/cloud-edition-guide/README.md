## Frequently asked questions - FAQ 


### Can I import my OpenProject community instance into my cloud environment?

Yes, we provide an upload possibility of your data to move from a Community installation to the Cloud Edition.
To import your community instance into our cloud environment, please send us the following files:
1. the database SQL dump of your local installation
2. the attachments of your local installation For a package-based installation, you can create both as root user on your environment as follows openproject run backup
This creates the attachment and postgresql-dump or mysql-dump under /var/db/openproject/backup.
If you are still running OpenProject under MySQL, your dump will be converted to PostgreSQL before importing, we will do this for you. More information about the backup tool can be found under this [link](https://www.openproject.org/operations/backup/backup-guide-packaged-installation/).
Before uploading the attachments securely to us using the [following form](https://openproject.org/saas-import), please contact us via support@openproject.com.
The form generates a direct upload to our secure S3 environment from which the import takes place.


### Where geographically is the OpenProject cloud data stored?

The OpenProject Cloud Environment is hosted on a logically isolated virtual cloud at Amazon Web Services with all services being located in Ireland. AWS is a GDPR compliant cloud infrastructure provider with extensive security and compliance programs as well as unparalleled access control mechanisms to ensure data privacy. Employed facilities are compliant with the ISO 27001 and 27018 standards. OpenProject Cloud Environment is continuously backing up user data with data at rest being fully encrypted with AES-256. Each individual's instance is logically separated and data is persisted in a unique database schema, reducing the risk of intersection or data leaks between instances. You can find more information [here](https://www.openproject.org/gdpr-compliance/).


### Does OpenProject comply with GDPR?

The protection of personal data is for OpenProject more than just a legal requirement. We are highly committed to data security and privacy. We are a company based in Berlin, the European Union, and the awareness and importance for data security and privacy actions have always been a major topic for us. OpenProject complies with GDPR and we handle our customerâ€™s data with care. Get more detailed information [here](https://www.openproject.org/gdpr-compliance/).


### How can I export the documents loaded on OpenProject?

Currently, there is unfortunately no option to export all the documents in OpenProject. We could manually export the entire database (including the attachments) for you. Due to the manual effort, we would however need to charge a service fee for this. Please contact sales@openproject.com.
