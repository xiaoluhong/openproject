# Integrations

If you have previously worked with other tools and want to switch or need an integration to OpenProject, there is a way to do so for some applications.

## Gitlab

The GitLab integration to OpenProject is currently being developed and you can find all information [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/21933#note_309977508).
We are prioritizing this topic at the moment and will update this guide with the latest developments.

## Jira

Currently, there is no direct integration between OpenProject and Jira. Since OpenProject is an excellent open source alternative to Jira, we have prepared a way to import tickets from Jira to OpenProject. First, you can export your tasks from Jira into an Excel file and then import these tasks via an [Excel plugin into OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/de/synchronize-excel-openproject/).

If you would like to learn more about the features of **OpenProject vs Jira** please read [here](https://www.openproject.org/jira-alternative/).

## Microsoft Project

There is an integration between MS Project and OpenProject. However, the synch plugin is not actively maintained at this time. If you wish to find out more, please [contact us](https://www.openproject.org/contact-us/).
To synchronize tasks from MS Project to OpenProject, you can export your MS Project file to Excel and then [synchronize it with OpenProject]( https://www.openproject.org/de/synchronize-excel-openproject/).

## Toggl

We do offer an integration between OpenProject and the [time tracking app toggl](../time-and-costs/time-tracking/toggl-integration/).

## Slack

We do offer a rudimentary OpenProject Slack integration.
