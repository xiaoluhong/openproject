# Invite members

In order to see a project and work in it, you have to be a member of a project. Therefore, you have to **add team members to a project**.

<div class="glossary">
**Member** is defined as a project member in a project. Project members are added in the members tab in the project settings.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
**Note**: If you are not a member of a project, you do not see the project in the Project selection nor in the project list.

</div>

## Add existing members

To add existing users to a project, [select the project](../projects/#select-a-project) where you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** menu item.

In the Members list you will get an overview of the current members of this project.

## Invite new members

You can also invite new members who have not yet an OpenProject account. [Select the project](../projects/#select-a-project) where you want to add members. In the project menu on the left, select the **Members** menu item.

Type in the email address of the new member. If OpenProject does not find an existing user, the **Invite** information will automatically be put before the email address. Assign a role to this new member and click the blue **Add** button.

An e-mail invitation will be sent out to the user with a link to [create an account](#create-a-new-account) for OpenProject.
