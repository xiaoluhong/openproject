                  *   insert text and format it with the toolbar,
                  *   insert text and images with copy and paste,
                  *   paste formatted text directly from MSOffice documents,
                  *   create a page hierarchy by inserting parent pages,
                  *   use makros to include, e.g. table of contents, work packages lists or Gantt charts,
                  *   include wiki pages in other text fields, e.g. project overview or meetings,
                  *   reference tickets with one, two or three "#"+ticket number, depending on what information should be displayed,
                  *   include links to other documents,
                  *   view the change history,

                    * Scrum Master moderates and notes down [Sprint Impediments](##sprint:"Sprint 1").
