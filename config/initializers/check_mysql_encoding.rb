     *   OpenProject requires UTF-8 encoding set on MySQL < 5.7              *
         and UTF-8mb4 beyond that. Please ensure having set
     *                                                                       *

         Otherwise, you WILL run into encoding issue when using 4 byte
     *   UTF-8 characters since utf8 encoding in MySQL doesn't support them. *

     *   If you have been running utf8 in the past, please see this guide    *
         on how to convert your database:
